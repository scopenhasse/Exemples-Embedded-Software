# Process of Compilation in C

This is a simple "Hello World" program written in the C programming language. It serves as an example to illustrate the process of compilation in C.

## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run the program, you must have the following software installed on your system:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Make

## Building the Program

To build the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the source code file "SourceFile.c" and the Makefile.
2. Run the `make` command to build the program. This will generate an executable binary file named "SourceFile".
3. Run the program by typing `./SourceFile` in the terminal window. This will execute the program and print the message "Hello World!" on the console.

If you make any changes to the source code file, you can rebuild the program by running the `make` command again.

To clean up the generated files, run the `make clean` command. This will remove all generated files, including the executable binary file, object file, assembly code file, and preprocessed source code file.

## File Descriptions

- SourceFile.c: The C source code file containing the "Hello World" program.
- Makefile: The Makefile containing the instructions for building the program.
- SourceFile.i: The preprocessed C source code file generated by the `gcc -E` command.
- SourceFile.s: The assembly code file generated by the `gcc -S` command.
- SourceFile.o: The object file generated by the `gcc -c` command.
- SourceFile: The executable binary file generated by the `gcc` command.
